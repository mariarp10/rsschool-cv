## Summary
Howdy ho! üëãüèª
I'm Maria, a Front-End Engineer with a pythonic twist, and a seasoned high-tech professional with background as a Product Owner. Over the past 1.5 years, I have built solid expertise in JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, TypeScript, RESTful APIs, OOP, and React.js, focusing on creating reliable, user-centered solutions.
I bring to my developer role the same strengths that made me successful as a Product Owner: clear communication with stakeholders, empathy for end-users, and strong analytical thinking. 
I thrive on solving complex problems and delivering practical, low-hanging fruit solutions that balance technical feasibility and user impact.

## Code Examples
```
/**
 * Finds the unique number in an array where all other numbers appear more than once.
 *
 * @param {number[]} arr - An array of numbers that contains exactly one unique number.
 * @returns {number} The unique number that appears only once in the array.

 @timecomplexity O(n) - It loops through the array twice: once to count and once to find the unique number.
 */
function findUniq(arr) {
  const counter = new Map();
  let unique;
  for (const num of arr) {
    if (!counter.has(num)) {
      counter.set(num, 1);
    } else {
      counter.set(num, counter.get(num) + 1);
    }
  }
  for (const [key, value] of counter.entries()) {
    if (value === 1) {
      unique = key;
    }
  }
  return unique;
}
```

```
/**
 * Solves a quadratic equation of the form ax¬≤ + bx + c = 0.
 * Uses a cache to store square root values for repeated discriminants.
 *
 * @param {number} a - The coefficient of x¬≤.
 * @param {number} b - The coefficient of x.
 * @param {number} c - The constant term.
 * @returns {(number[]|undefined)} An array of real solutions, or undefined if there are no real solutions.
 */
const sqrtCache = new Map();

function solveQuadratic(a, b, c) {
  if (a === 0) {
    if (b === 0) return;
    return [-c / b];
  }

  const D = b ** 2 - 4 * a * c;

  if (D < 0) return;
  if (D === 0) return [-b / (2 * a)];

  let sqrtD;
  if (sqrtCache.has(D)) {
    sqrtD = sqrtCache.get(D);
  } else {
    sqrtD = Math.sqrt(D);
    sqrtCache.set(D, sqrtD);
  }

  return [(-b + sqrtD) / (2 * a), (-b - sqrtD) / (2 * a)];
}
